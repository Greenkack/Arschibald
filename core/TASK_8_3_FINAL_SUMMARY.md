## Integration

### DatabaseManager Integration ✅

The `DatabaseManager` class has been enhanced to use `EnhancedConnectionManager`:

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, use_enhanced_connection_manager: bool = True):
        if self.use_enhanced_connection_manager:
            self.connection_manager = create_connection_manager(...)
```

**New Methods Added**:
- `get_connection_pool_metrics()` - Get pool metrics
- `detect_connection_leaks()` - Detect leaked connections
- `get_health_monitor_stats()` - Get health statistics
- `get_failover_status()` - Get failover status
- `dispose_connections()` - Dispose all connections

**Verification**: ✅ PASSED

---

# Get session
session = db_manager.get_session()
try:
    result = session.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
finally:
    session.close()

# Check health
health = db_manager.health_check()
print(f"Database healthy: {health['healthy']}")

# Get metrics
metrics = db_manager.get_connection_pool_metrics()
print(f"Pool utilization: {metrics['utilization']}")

# Check for leaks
leaks = db_manager.detect_connection_leaks()
print(f"Leaked connections: {len(leaks)}")
```
