### Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Sensitive data is masked in logs
- [ ] Log files have appropriate permissions

### Code Security

- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Code follows secure coding practices
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Exceptions are caught and handled properly

### Testing

- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Path traversal tests pass
- [ ] Command injection tests pass
- [ ] Input validation tests pass
- [ ] Docker security tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass

## Runtime Security Checklist

Use this checklist during operation to maintain security.

### Daily Checks

- [ ] Review security logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor resource usage for anomalies
- [ ] Verify Docker containers are cleaned up

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Review API usage for unusual patterns

- [ ] Verify backup of configuration
- [ ] Test security features

### Monthly Checks

- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Audit user access and permissions
- [ ] Review security logs comprehensively
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

### Quarterly Checks

- [ ] Conduct security audit
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing

## Incident Response Checklist

Use this checklist if a security incident is suspected.

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Stop all agent operations
- [ ] Isolate affected systems
- [ ] Preserve logs and evidence
- [ ] Notify security team/administrator

### Investigation

- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Check for unauthorized access
- [ ] Identify compromised resources
- [ ] Determine scope of incident
- [ ] Document findings

### Remediation

- [ ] Remove malicious code/containers
- [ ] Patch vulnerabilities
- [ ] Rotate all API keys
- [ ] Update security measures
- [ ] Test fixes

### Recovery

- [ ] Restore from clean backup if needed
- [ ] Verify system integrity
- [ ] Resume operations gradually
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### Post-Incident

- [ ] Conduct post-mortem analysis
- [ ] Update security procedures
- [ ] Implement additional controls
- [ ] Train team on new procedures
- [ ] Report to stakeholders

## Security Validation Commands

### Check Configuration

```bash
# Validate configuration
python Agent/validate_config.py

# Check API keys (without displaying them)
python -c "from Agent.config import check_api_keys; print(check_api_keys())"

# Verify .env is in .gitignore
grep "^\.env$" .gitignore
```

### Test Security Features

```bash
# Run security tests
python Agent/test_security.py

# Test path validation
python -c "from Agent.agent.security import validate_path; print(validate_path('../etc/passwd', '/app/workspace'))"

# Test command validation
python -c "from Agent.agent.security import validate_command; print(validate_command('rm -rf /'))"
```

### Check Docker Security

```bash
# Verify Docker image
docker images | grep kai_agent_sandbox

# Check container user
docker run --rm kai_agent_sandbox whoami
# Should output: sandboxuser

# Test network isolation
docker run --rm --network none kai_agent_sandbox ping -c 1 google.com
# Should fail with network unreachable

# Check resource limits
docker inspect kai_agent_sandbox | grep -A 10 "Memory"
```

### Monitor Operations

```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps

# View security logs
tail -f Agent/logs/agent_errors_*.log

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** - Always use .env files
2. **Validate all input** - Never trust user input
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent injection attacks
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Patch vulnerabilities
5. **Follow least privilege** - Minimal permissions
6. **Log security events** - Maintain audit trail
7. **Handle errors securely** - Don't expose details
8. **Test security features** - Regular testing

### For Users

1. **Keep API keys secret** - Never share or commit
2. **Use strong keys** - Generate secure keys
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Change periodically
4. **Monitor usage** - Check API dashboards
5. **Report issues** - Report security concerns
6. **Keep software updated** - Install updates
7. **Review logs** - Check for anomalies
8. **Backup configuration** - Regular backups

### For Administrators

1. **Enforce security policies** - Implement controls
2. **Monitor systems** - Continuous monitoring
3. **Conduct audits** - Regular security audits
4. **Train users** - Security awareness
5. **Maintain documentation** - Keep updated
6. **Test procedures** - Regular testing
7. **Plan for incidents** - Incident response plan
8. **Review access** - Audit permissions

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- **OWASP Top 10** - Address common vulnerabilities
