# Task 14: Build and Test Docker Sandbox - COMPLETE

## Overview

Task 14 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive build scripts, test suites, and verification tools for the Docker sandbox environment.

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 5.1**: Code execution in Docker container with restricted permissions
- **Requirement 5.2**: Unprivileged user execution (sandboxuser, not root)
- **Requirement 5.3**: Network isolation by default
- **Requirement 5.4**: Automatic cleanup and timeout handling
- **Requirement 5.5**: Python environment setup

## Task 14.1: Build Docker Image ✓

### Files Created

1. **Agent/sandbox/build.sh** - Linux/Mac build script
   - Checks Docker availability
   - Builds the image
   - Tests the image
   - Shows image details

2. **Agent/sandbox/build.ps1** - Windows PowerShell build script
   - Checks Docker availability
   - Builds the image with progress
   - Tests the image
   - Shows image details with color output

3. **Agent/verify_docker_build.py** - Comprehensive verification script
   - Verifies Docker is available
   - Checks image exists
   - Verifies Python 3.11 environment
   - Confirms unprivileged user (sandboxuser)
   - Tests workspace directory
   - Verifies installed packages
   - Checks security features
   - Tests basic execution

### Build Instructions

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd Agent\sandbox
.\build.ps1
```

#### Linux/Mac (Bash)

```bash
cd Agent/sandbox
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

#### Python Build Script

```bash
python Agent/build_sandbox.py
```

#### Manual Build

```bash
cd Agent/sandbox
docker build -t kai_agent_sandbox .
```

### Verification

After building, verify the image:

```bash
python Agent/verify_docker_build.py
```

This checks:
- ✓ Docker is available
- ✓ Image exists
- ✓ Python 3.11 environment
- ✓ Unprivileged user (sandboxuser, UID 1000)
- ✓ Workspace directory (/app/workspace)
- ✓ Required packages (pytest, requests, python-dotenv)
- ✓ Security features (no sudo, cannot write to /etc)
- ✓ Basic execution works

## Task 14.2: Test Sandbox Execution ✓

### Files Created

1. **Agent/test_sandbox_complete.py** - Comprehensive test suite
   - Tests all sandbox features
   - Covers all requirements
   - Provides detailed output
   - Tracks test results

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

#### Python Code Execution (Requirement 5.1)
- ✓ Simple Python code execution

- ✓ Terminal command timeout (120 seconds)
- ✓ Timeout messages returned
- ✓ Containers terminated on timeout

#### Automatic Cleanup (Requirement 5.4)
- ✓ Containers removed after execution
- ✓ No leftover containers
- ✓ Resources freed properly

#### Unprivileged User (Requirement 5.2)
- ✓ Runs as sandboxuser (not root)
- ✓ UID is 1000 (non-zero)
- ✓ No sudo access
- ✓ Cannot escalate privileges

#### Security Features
- ✓ Cannot write to system directories
- ✓ Limited shell access

#### Quick Test (existing test suite)

```bash
python Agent/test_execution_tools.py
```

#### Comprehensive Test (Task 14 test suite)

```bash
python Agent/test_sandbox_complete.py
```

This runs all tests including:
- Task 14.1 tests (image build verification)
- Task 14.2 tests (sandbox execution)
- Optional timeout tests (takes ~3 minutes)

Optional (if run):
✓ Timeout handling (Python)
✓ Timeout handling (Terminal)
```

## Docker Image Specifications

### Base Image
- **Image**: python:3.11-slim
- **Size**: ~150-200 MB
- **Security**: Minimal attack surface

### User Configuration
- **User**: sandboxuser
- **UID**: 1000
- **Home**: /home/sandboxuser
- **Shell**: /bin/bash
- **Privileges**: None (no sudo)

### Directory Structure
```
/app/
├── requirements.txt
├── workspace/          # Working directory for code execution
└── (installed packages)
```

### Installed Packages
- pytest (testing framework)
- requests (HTTP library)
- python-dotenv (environment variables)

### Security Features
1. **Unprivileged User**: All code runs as sandboxuser (UID 1000)
2. **No Root Access**: Cannot escalate privileges
3. **Network Isolation**: Network disabled by default
4. **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits enforced at runtime
5. **Read-Only System**: Cannot modify system files
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Containers removed after execution
7. **Timeout Protection**: 30s for Python, 120s for terminal

### Runtime Configuration
```python
# Network disabled
network_mode='none'

# Resource limits
mem_limit='512m'
cpu_quota=50000

# Security options
security_opt=['no-new-privileges']

# Automatic removal
remove=True
```

## Integration with Agent

The sandbox is used by the agent's execution tools:

### Python Code Execution
```python
from agent.tools.execution_tools import execute_python_code_in_sandbox

code = "print('Hello from sandbox')"
result = execute_python_code_in_sandbox.invoke({"code": code})
```

### Terminal Command Execution
```python
from agent.tools.execution_tools import run_terminal_command_in_sandbox

command = "pip list"
result = run_terminal_command_in_sandbox.invoke({"command": command})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Available

**Error**: "Docker is not available"

**Solution**:
1. Install Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
2. Start Docker
3. Verify: `docker ps`

### Image Not Found

**Error**: "Image 'kai_agent_sandbox' not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Build the image
python Agent/build_sandbox.py

# Or manually
cd Agent/sandbox
docker build -t kai_agent_sandbox .
```

### Permission Denied (Linux)

**Error**: "Permission denied while trying to connect to Docker"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and log back in
```

### Build Fails

**Error**: Build process fails

**Solution**:
1. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check Dockerfile exists: `ls Agent/sandbox/Dockerfile`
3. Check requirements.txt exists: `ls Agent/sandbox/requirements.txt`
4. Try manual build with verbose output:
   ```bash
   cd Agent/sandbox
   docker build -t kai_agent_sandbox . --progress=plain
   ```

### Container Timeout

**Error**: "Container execution timed out"

**Solution**:
- Python code: Optimize to run in < 30 seconds
- Terminal commands: Optimize to run in < 120 seconds
- Or modify timeouts in `agent/tools/execution_tools.py`

### Network Access Needed

**Error**: "Network is blocked"

**Solution**:
Use the network-enabled execution function:
```python
from agent.tools.execution_tools import execute_python_code_with_network

code = "import requests; print(requests.get('https://api.github.com').status_code)"
result = execute_python_code_with_network.invoke({"code": code})
```
