# Agent Workspace Directory

This is the secure workspace where the KAI Agent can read and write files.

## Security

- All agent file operations are restricted to this directory
- Path traversal attempts are blocked
- Files outside this directory cannot be accessed
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Contents

The agent can create:

- Python scripts and applications
- Configuration files
- Test files
- Documentation
- Data files
- Project structures

## Usage

The agent uses these tools:

- `write_file(path, content)`: Create or overwrite files
- `read_file(path)`: Read file contents
- `list_files(path)`: List directory contents
- `generate_project_structure()`: Create complete projects

## Example Structure

After agent creates a Flask project:

```
agent_workspace/
├── my_flask_app/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── tests/
│   │   └── test_app.py
│   └── README.md
```

## Cleanup

You can safely delete contents of this directory when not in use.
The agent will recreate files as needed.
