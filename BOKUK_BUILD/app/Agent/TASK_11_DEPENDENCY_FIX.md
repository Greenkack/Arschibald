# Task 11 - Dependency Installation Fix

## Issue

The error message indicates that `langchain_openai` module is not found:
```
Import-Fehler Modul 'agent_ui': No module named 'langchain_openai'
```

## Solution

The dependency is already listed in `requirements.txt`, but it needs to be installed in your Python environment.

### Option 1: Install All Dependencies (Recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- `langchain-openai==0.3.0`
- `langchain==0.3.20`
- `langchain-community==0.3.20`
- And all other required packages

### Option 2: Install Only Missing Dependency

```bash
pip install langchain-openai==0.3.0
```

### Option 3: Install Agent-Specific Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r Agent/requirements.txt
```

## Verification

After installation, verify the module is available:

```bash
python -c "import langchain_openai; print('✅ langchain_openai installed successfully')"
```

Or run the verification test:

```bash
python Agent/test_task_11_verification.py
```

## Expected Result

After installing the dependencies, the import error should be resolved and all modules should load correctly.

## Note

This is not a code issue - Task 11 implementation is complete and correct. This is simply a dependency installation issue that needs to be resolved in your Python environment.

**Status:** Task 11 code is complete ✅  
**Action Required:** Install dependencies in your Python environment
