## Key Features

### 1. Query Performance Tracking
```python
monitor.record_query(
    query="SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1",
    duration=0.15,
    rows_affected=1,
    connection_id="conn_123",
    user_id="user_456"
)
```

### 2. Slow Query Detection
```python
# Automatic detection with configurable thresholds
slow_queries = monitor.get_slow_queries(limit=10)
very_slow_queries = monitor.get_very_slow_queries(limit=5)
```

### 3. Connection Pool Monitoring
```python
monitor.update_pool_metrics(
    pool_size=10,
    checked_out=7,
    checked_in=3,
    overflow=0
)
```

### 4. Real-time Statistics
```python
stats = monitor.get_stats()
print(f"Total Queries: {stats.total_queries}")
print(f"Slow Queries: {stats.slow_queries}")
print(f"Error Rate: {stats.error_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Pool Usage: {stats.connection_pool_usage:.1%}")
```

### 5. Automated Alerts
```python
def alert_handler(alert):
    print(f"ALERT: {alert.message}")
    send_to_monitoring_system(alert)

monitor.register_alert_callback(alert_handler)
```

### 6. Optimization Recommendations
```python
recommendations = monitor.get_recommendations()
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"[{rec.priority}] {rec.title}")
    print(f"Impact: {rec.impact} | Effort: {rec.effort}")
```

### 7. Query Analysis
```python
# By query type
stats_by_type = monitor.get_query_stats_by_type()

# By table
stats_by_table = monitor.get_query_stats_by_table()
```

## Integration Points

### With DatabaseManager
The performance monitor integrates seamlessly with the existing `DatabaseManager` class through SQLAlchemy event listeners.

### With Connection Manager
Works with the `EnhancedConnectionManager` to provide comprehensive connection pool monitoring.

### With Monitoring Systems
Alert callbacks enable integration with:
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Datadog
- New Relic
- Custom monitoring solutions

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- Configurable history limits prevent unbounded growth
- Efficient deque-based storage for recent queries
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### Thread Safety
- All operations are thread-safe using locks
- Safe for concurrent use in multi-threaded applications
- Tested with concurrent query recording

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead (<1ms per query)
- Asynchronous alert processing
- Efficient metric aggregation

```python
from sqlalchemy import event

@event.listens_for(engine, "before_cursor_execute")
def before_query(conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context, executemany):
    context._query_start_time = time.time()

@event.listens_for(engine, "after_cursor_execute")
def after_query(conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context, executemany):
    if hasattr(context, '_query_start_time'):
        duration = time.time() - context._query_start_time
        monitor.record_query(query=statement, duration=duration)
```

### Dashboard
```python
def print_dashboard():
    stats = monitor.get_stats()
    print(f"Total Queries: {stats.total_queries}")
    print(f"Slow Queries: {stats.slow_queries}")
