# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for transforming the existing Streamlit application into a production-ready, maximally robust system with zero data loss, stable UI navigation, minimal recompute times, and enterprise-grade reliability. The enhancement builds upon the existing architecture while implementing comprehensive state management, persistence, job processing, security, and operational excellence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: State Management & Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation between pages without losing any input data or experiencing UI jumps, so that I can work efficiently without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria
