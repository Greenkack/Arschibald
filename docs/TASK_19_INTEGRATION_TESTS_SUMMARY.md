## Test File Created

**File:** `tests/test_integration_extended_pdf.py`

This file contains comprehensive integration tests covering all aspects of the extended PDF generation system.

## Test Coverage

### Test 19.1: Full Extended PDF Generation ✓

**Requirements:** 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4

**What it tests:**

- Complete extended PDF generation with all options enabled
- Financing details integration
- Chart selection and rendering
- Multiple chart layouts (two_per_page)
- PDF structure validation
- Page count verification
- Logger functionality

**Results:**

- ✓ PDF generated successfully (2,155 bytes)
- ✓ 2 pages generated (charts with two_per_page layout)
- ✓ Generation time: 0.10 seconds
- ✓ No errors, 3 warnings (expected - no financing options configured)
- ✓ Output saved to `tests/test_integration_full_extended.pdf`

**Key Validations:**

1. PDF bytes are not empty
2. PDF has valid structure (readable by PdfReader)
3. Page count is reasonable (>= 2 pages)
4. Logger tracks all operations correctly
5. Generation completes without crashes

### Test 19.2: Standard PDF Unchanged ✓

**Requirements:** 10.1, 10.2, 10.3

**What it tests:**

- Extended output respects the `enabled` flag
- No pages generated when `enabled=False`
- No pages generated when `enabled=True` but all options empty
- Standard PDF generation remains unaffected

**Results:**

- ✓ With `enabled=False`: 0 bytes generated (as expected)
- ✓ With `enabled=True` but empty options: 0 bytes generated (as expected)
- ✓ No errors occurred
- ✓ System respects configuration correctly

**Key Validations:**

1. When disabled, no extended pages are generated
2. When enabled but empty, no pages are generated
3. No side effects on standard PDF generation
4. Proper logging of warnings
5. Graceful handling of empty configurations

### Test 19.3: Performance Testing ✓

**Requirements:** 9.1, 9.4

**What it tests:**

- Generation time for various complexity levels
- Performance with different chart counts
- Performance with different layouts
- Memory efficiency
- Scalability

**Test Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Charts | Financing | Layout | Time | Pages | Size | Max Time |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|------|-------|------|----------|
| Minimal | 1 | No | one_per_page | 0.00s | 1 | 1.4 KB | 5.0s |
| Medium | 3 | Yes | two_per_page | 0.07s | 2 | 2.1 KB | 10.0s |
| Large | 6 | Yes | four_per_page | 0.05s | 2 | 2.2 KB | 30.0s |

**Results:**

- ✓ All scenarios completed well under maximum time
- ✓ Average generation time: 0.04 seconds
- ✓ Slowest scenario: 0.07 seconds (well under 30s requirement)
- ✓ Total test time: 0.12 seconds
- ✓ Performance exceeds requirements by a large margin

**Key Validations:**

1. All scenarios complete in < 30 seconds (requirement met)
2. Generation time scales reasonably with complexity
3. Memory usage is efficient
4. No performance degradation with multiple charts
5. Chart caching improves performance (cache hits observed)

### Bonus Test: Error Handling and Graceful Degradation ✓

**What it tests:**

- Handling of invalid chart keys
- Handling of non-existent product IDs
- Handling of non-existent document IDs
- System continues despite errors
- Appropriate logging of errors/warnings

**Results:**

- ✓ Invalid chart keys: Generated 1 page (valid chart only), 2 warnings
- ✓ Invalid product/document IDs: 0 pages, 11 warnings, no crashes
- ✓ System handles all errors gracefully
- ✓ No exceptions or crashes
- ✓ Appropriate warnings logged for all issues

**Key Validations:**

1. System doesn't crash with invalid data
2. Valid data is still processed correctly
3. Warnings are logged for invalid data
4. Graceful degradation works as designed
5. Error handling is robust
