# Requirements Document - KAI Agent Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the KAI (KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz) Agent system into the existing Bokuk2 application. The KAI Agent is an autonomous AI expert system with dual expertise: renewable energy consulting (photovoltaics and heat pumps) and software architecture. The agent features outbound calling capabilities, knowledge base integration, code execution in sandboxed environments, and comprehensive testing tools.

## Requirements

2. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL use pytest in the sandbox environment
3. IF a test fails THEN the agent SHALL analyze the failure, form a hypothesis, and attempt to fix the code
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL report success with detailed test output
5. IF pytest is not available THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions

### Requirement 9: Web Search Integration
